## Day One

(Writing in day like format for anyone interested in my process)
Completed design of the website on Figma. Had a lot of fun with designing. Dipping my feet in some features that are a bit more advanced for the current me, but nevertheless, still try. I want to build a leader board that tracks user data live. I want to add levels and infinite levels. I want to add a loading screen with loading bar. I want to make website look good. I want website to have three pages: homepage, game, and leader board. I want to be very consistent with the styled components I use. I want the website to be a actual game. I also need to create a credits for the planet images I am using. I need to create sort feature. Tomorrow: write all the features I want to have, and complete HTML & CSS tomorrow with page routing.
